While the first-principles GW approach is state-of-the-art, the computational cost is high for large interface systems. This has led to the substrate screening GW approach for weakly coupled interfaces, which breaks down for covalently bonded interfaces. In this work, we present the generalized substrate screening GW approach, based on the following two considerations: (i) the contribution of the interfacial covalent bond to the polarizability can be efficiently calculated with a low energy cutoff; (ii) the contribution of the deprotonated adsorbate to the interface polarizability can be well approximated by that of the protonated molecule. Our approach is exemplified using interfaces formed between benzene-1,4-dithiol (BDT) and Au(111), which feature the widely used Au-S bonds in experiments. Our work provides a robust and simple scheme for accurate and efficient GW calculations of covalently bonded interfaces.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pub mb-5\">\n  <div class=\"pub-image\"><img src=\"/assets/img/publications/featured.webp\" class=\"thumb rounded\" alt=\"Hydrogen Isotope Labeling of Pharmaceuticals Via Dual Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Pathways Using CdS Quantum Dot Photocatalyst\"></div>\n  <div class=\"pub-body\">\n    <div class=\"pub-badge-wrap\"><span class=\"pub-badge\">JACS</span></div>\n    <div class=\"pub-title fw-semibold h5 mb-0\"><a class=\"pub-title-link\" href=\"/publications/articles/maity-dungan-2024/\">Hydrogen Isotope Labeling of Pharmaceuticals Via Dual Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Pathways Using CdS Quantum Dot Photocatalyst</a></div>\n    <div class=\"text-muted small mt-1\">Rajendra Maity, Otto Dungan, Frédéric A.

Traditional methods suffer from limitations in scope and selectivity. Here, we present a photocatalytic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) method using CdS quantum dots that operates via dual pathways: direct HAT from the CdS quantum dot surface and photogenerated hole-mediated oxidation. This dual mechanism enables broad applicability to various pharmaceutical compounds, including complex drug molecules like celecoxib, roflumilast, and mavoglurant. The method shows excellent deuterium incorporation with high precision and minimal byproduct formation. Our work demonstrates the potential of quantum dot photocatalysis for pharmaceutical isotope labeling applications.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"pub mb-5\">\n  <div class=\"pub-image\"><img src=\"/assets/img/publications/featured.webp\" class=\"thumb rounded\" alt=\"Understanding Ligand Exchange and Surface Passivation in CdS Quantum Dots from First Principles\"></div>\n  <div class=\"pub-body\">\n    <div class=\"pub-badge-wrap\"><span class=\"pub-badge\">Chem.

The surface chemistry of QDs plays a crucial role in determining their properties and stability. In this work, we use first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate ligand exchange processes and surface passivation mechanisms in CdS quantum dots. We examine how different ligands interact with CdS surfaces and how these interactions affect the electronic structure and optical properties of the QDs. Our calculations provide insights into the binding energies, electronic structure changes, and passivation effects of various ligand molecules on CdS QD surfaces.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"year-chunk\"><div class=\"year-label\">2023</div>\n<div class=\"pub mb-5\">\n  <div class=\"pub-image\"><img src=\"/assets/img/publications/featured.webp\" class=\"thumb rounded\" alt=\"Electrochemical Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Amines Controlled by Alternating Current Frequency\"></div>\n  <div class=\"pub-body\">\n    <div class=\"pub-badge-wrap\"><span class=\"pub-badge\">Faraday Discuss.</span></div>\n    <div class=\"pub-title fw-semibold h5 mb-0\"><a class=\"pub-title-link\" href=\"/publications/articles/behera-gunasekera-2023/\">Electrochemical Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Amines Controlled by Alternating Current Frequency</a></div>\n    <div class=\"text-muted small mt-1\">Nibedita Behera, Disni Gunasekera, Jyoti P.

Tetrahydroisoquinoline and pyrrolidine are selected as two model substrates because of their different proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) kinetics at the alpha-C(sp3)-H amine sites, which are utilized to control the HIE reaction outcome at different applied alternating current (AC) frequencies. We found the highest deuterium incorporation for tetrahydroisoquinolines at 0 Hz (i.e., under direct current (DC) electrolysis conditions) and pyrrolidines at 0.5 Hz. Analysis of the product distribution and D isotope incorporation at different frequencies reveals that the HIE of tetrahydroisoquinolines is limited by its slow HAT, whereas the HIE of pyrrolidines is limited by the overoxidation of its alpha-amino radical intermediates. The AC-frequency-dependent HIE of amines can be potentially used to achieve selective labeling of alpha-amine sites in one drug molecule, which will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"year-chunk\"><div class=\"year-label\">2022</div>\n<div class=\"pub mb-5 pub-hidden\">\n  <div class=\"pub-image\"><img src=\"/assets/img/publications/featured.webp\" class=\"thumb rounded\" alt=\"Comparative Study of Covalent and van Der Waals CdS Quantum Dot Assemblies from Many-Body Perturbation Theory\"></div>\n  <div class=\"pub-body\">\n    <div class=\"pub-badge-wrap\"><span class=\"pub-badge\">J.

Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we systematically compare the electronic and optical properties of two types of CdS QD assemblies that have been experimentally investigated: (i) QD gels, where individual QDs are covalently connected via di- or polysulfide bonds, and (ii) QD nanocrystals, where individual QDs are bound via van der Waals interactions. Our work illustrates how the electronic and optical properties evolve when discrete QDs are assembled into 1D, 2D, and 3D gels and nanocrystals, as well as how the one-body and many-body interactions in these systems impact the trends as the dimensionality of the assembly increases. Furthermore, our work reveals the crucial role of the di- or polysulfide covalent bonds in the localization of the excitons, which highlights the difference between QD gels and QD nanocrystals.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</section><section class=\"year-chunk\"><div class=\"year-label\">2021</div>\n<div class=\"pub mb-5 pub-hidden\">\n  <div class=\"pub-image\"><img src=\"/assets/img/publications/featured.webp\" class=\"thumb rounded\" alt=\"Quasiparticle Electronic Structure of Two-Dimensional Heterotriangulene-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks Adsorbed on Au(111)\"></div>\n  <div class=\"pub-body\">\n    <div class=\"pub-badge-wrap\"><span class=\"pub-badge\">J.

The fabrications of such devices often involve interfaces formed between COFs and substrates. In this work, we employ the first-principles GW approach to accurately determine the quasiparticle electronic structure of three 2D carbonyl bridged heterotriangulene-based COFs featuring honeycomb-kagome lattice, with their properties ranging from a semi-metal to a wide-gap semiconductor. Moreover, we study the adsorption of these COFs on Au(111) surface and characterize the quasiparticle electronic structure at the heterogeneous COF/Au(111) interfaces. To reduce the computational cost, we apply the recently developed dielectric embedding GW approach and show that our results agree with existing experimental measurement on the interfacial energy level alignment. Our calculations illustrate how the many-body dielectric screening at the interface modulates the energies and shapes of the Dirac bands, the effective masses of semiconducting COFs, as well as the Fermi velocity of the semi-metallic COF.</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</section><div class=\"text-center mt-4\"><button id=\"show-more-pubs\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Show More Publications</button></div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"pub-search-empty\" class=\"alert alert-info d-none\" role=\"status\">\n  No publications match your search yet.

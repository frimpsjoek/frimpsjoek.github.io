## Teaching Snapshot

- **Teaching interests:** electronic-structure theory (DFT → GW/BSE), computational chemistry, scientific programming for materials scientists, and reproducible HPC workflows.  
- **Mentoring focus:** inclusive, project-based research experiences that pair modern software practices with rigorous physical insight.  
- **Formats delivered:** graduate mini-courses, bootcamps, invited tutorials, and K–12 outreach workshops.

## University Instruction & Mentorship

- **Chemistry Meets Computers (Wayne State University, 2021–2023)** — Designed and taught a three-week intensive introducing Python, NumPy, and ASE for chemistry majors; mentored >40 students who carried projects into research groups.  
- **Graduate lab mentor (2019–2024)** — Supervised undergraduate and master’s researchers on GW/BSE workflows, resulting in co-authored publications and conference posters.  
- **Argonne postdoctoral mentoring (2024–present)** — Onboard new users to NST Division computing stack; run weekly code clinics on automation and data management.

## Outreach & Community Engagement

- **NOBCChE Detroit STEM outreach (2021–2023)** — Led hands-on demonstrations for K–12 classrooms, emphasizing computational chemistry careers for underrepresented students.  
- **STEM camp facilitator (2019–2023)** — Developed project modules linking quantum dots, coding, and sustainability for summer programs.  
- **Science communication** — Author of “Reflections of a young academic”, a blog translating computational materials research for broad audiences.

## Professional Service

- NOBCChE National Conference Planning Committee (2022–present) — design technical programming and mentoring sessions.  
- Social Media Coordinator & Secretary, NOBCChE @ Wayne State (2021–2023) — organized events and communication channels supporting graduate student development.

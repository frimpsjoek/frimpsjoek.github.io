    "text": "Abstract\nPharmaceutical synthesis often requires hydrogen isotope labeling for drug development and mechanistic studies. Traditional methods suffer from limitations in scope and selectivity. Here, we present a photocatalytic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) method using CdS quantum dots that operates via dual pathways: direct HAT from the CdS quantum dot surface and photogenerated hole-mediated oxidation. This dual mechanism enables broad applicability to various pharmaceutical compounds, including complex drug molecules like celecoxib, roflumilast, and mavoglurant. The method shows excellent deuterium incorporation with high precision and minimal byproduct formation. Our work demonstrates the potential of quantum dot photocatalysis for pharmaceutical isotope labeling applications."

    "text": "Abstract\nQuantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanoparticles with unique optical and electronic properties that make them valuable for various applications including solar cells, LEDs, and biological imaging. The surface chemistry of QDs plays a crucial role in determining their properties and stability. In this work, we use first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate ligand exchange processes and surface passivation mechanisms in CdS quantum dots. We examine how different ligands interact with CdS surfaces and how these interactions affect the electronic structure and optical properties of the QDs. Our calculations provide insights into the binding energies, electronic structure changes, and passivation effects of various ligand molecules on CdS QD surfaces."

    "text": "Here we will give you some tips on how to customize the website. One important thing to note is that ALL the changes you make should be done on the main branch of your repository. The gh-pages branch is automatically overwritten every time you make a change to the main branch.\n\n\nThe project is structured as follows, focusing on the main components that you will need to modify:\n.\n├── 📂 assets/: contains the assets that are displayed in the website\n│   └── 📂 json/\n    │   └── 📄 resume.json: CV in JSON format (https://jsonresume.org/)\n├── 📂 _bibliography/\n│   └── 📄 papers.bib: bibliography in BibTeX format\n├── 📄 _config.yml: the configuration file of the template\n├── 📂 _data/: contains some of the data used in the template\n│   ├── 📄 cv.yml: CV in YAML format, used when assets/json/resume.json is not found\n│   └── 📄 repositories.yml: users and repositories info in YAML format\n├── 📂 _includes/: contains code parts that are included in the main HTML file\n│   └── 📄 news.liquid: defines the news section layout in the about page\n├── 📂 _layouts/: contains the layouts to choose from in the frontmatter of the Markdown files\n├── 📂 _news/: the news that will appear in the news section in the about page\n├── 📂 _pages/: contains the pages of the website\n|   └── 📄 404.md: 404 page (page not found)\n├── 📂 _posts/: contains the blog posts\n├── 📂 _projects/: contains the projects\n└── 📂 _sass/: contains the SASS files that define the style of the website\n    ├── 📄 _base.scss: base style of the website\n    ├── 📄 _cv.scss: style of the CV page\n    ├── 📄 _distill.scss: style of the Distill articles\n    ├── 📄 _layout.scss: style of the overall layout\n    ├── 📄 _themes.scss: themes colors and a few icons\n    └── 📄 _variables.scss: variables used in the SASS files\n\n\n\nThe configuration file _config.yml contains the main configuration of the website. Most of the settings is self-explanatory and we also tried to add as much comments as possible. If you have any questions, please check if it was not already answered in the FAQ.\n\nNote that the url and baseurl settings are used to generate the links of the website, as explained in the install instructions.\n\nAll changes made to this file are only visible after you rebuild the website. That means that you need to run bundle exec jekyll serve again if you are running the website locally or push your changes to GitHub if you are using GitHub Pages. All other changes are visible immediately, you only need to refresh the page.\n\n\n\nThere are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in assets/json/resume.json. It is a known standard for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in _data/cv.yml. This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.\nWhat this means is, if there is no resume data defined in _config.yml and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of _data/cv.yml. If you want to use the _data/cv.yml file as the source of your CV, you must delete the assets/json/resume.json file.\n\n\n\nThe user and repository information is defined in _data/repositories.yml. You can add as many users and repositories as you want. Both informations are used in the repositories section.\n\n\n\nYou can create new pages by adding new Markdown files in the _pages directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing page and modify it. You can choose the layout of the page by changing the layout attribute in the frontmatter of the Markdown file, and also the path to access it by changing the permalink attribute. You can also add new layouts in the _layouts directory if you feel the need for it.\n\n\n\nTo create a new blog post, you can add a new Markdown file in the _posts directory. The name of the file must follow the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing blog post and modify it. Note that some blog posts have optional fields in the frontmatter that are used to enable specific behaviors or functions.\nIf you want to create blog posts that are not ready to be published, but you want to track it with git, you can create a _drafts directory and store them there.\n\n\n\nYou can create new projects by adding new Markdown files in the _projects directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing project and modify it.\n\n\n\nYou can add news in the about page by adding new Markdown files in the _news directory. There are currently two types of news: inline news and news with a link. News with a link take you to a new page while inline news are displayed directly in the about page. The easiest way to create yours is to copy an existing news and modify it.\n\n\n\nThis Jekyll theme implements collections to let you break up your work into categories. The theme comes with two default collections: news and projects. Items from the news collection are automatically displayed on the home page. Items from the projects collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.\nYou can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is. To do this, edit the collections in the _config.yml file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to _pages/projects.md.\n\n\n\nTo add publications create a new entry in the _bibliography/papers.bib file. You can find the BibTeX entry of a publication in Google Scholar by clicking on the quotation marks below the publication title, then clicking on “BibTeX”, or also in the conference page itself. By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the Jekyll Scholar section in _config.yml file.\nYou can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the assets/pdfs/ directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the pdf field. Some of the supported fields are: abstract, altmetric, annotation, arxiv, bibtex_show, blog, code, dimensions, doi, eprint, html, isbn, pdf, pmid, poster, slides, supp, video, and website.\n\n\nIn publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array scholar:last_name and string array scholar:first_name in _config.yml. For example, if you have the following entry in your _config.yml:\nscholar:\n  last_name: [Einstein]\n  first_name: [Albert, A.]\nIf the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined. Keep meta-information about your co-authors in _data/coauthors.yml and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically. The co-author data format is as follows, with the last names lower cased and without accents as the key:\n\"adams\":\n  - firstname: [\"Edwin\", \"E.\", \"E. P.\", \"Edwin Plimpton\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams\n\n\"podolsky\":\n  - firstname: [\"Boris\", \"B.\", \"B. Y.\", \"Boris Yakovlevich\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky\n\n\"rosen\":\n  - firstname: [\"Nathan\", \"N.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen\n\n\"bach\":\n  - firstname: [\"Johann Sebastian\", \"J. S.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach\n\n  - firstname: [\"Carl Philipp Emanuel\", \"C. P. E.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach\nIf the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided. Note that the keys MUST BE lower cased and MUST NOT contain accents. This is because the keys are used to match the last names in the BibTeX entries, considering possible variations.\n\n\n\nThere are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:\n\nabbr: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.\nabstract: Adds an “Abs” button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text\naltmetric: Adds an Altmetric badge (Note: if DOI is provided just use true, otherwise only add the altmetric identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nannotation: Adds a popover info message to the end of the author list that can potentially be used to clarify superscripts. HTML is allowed.\narxiv: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nbibtex_show: Adds a “Bib” button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry\nblog: Adds a “Blog” button redirecting to the specified link\ncode: Adds a “Code” button redirecting to the specified link\ndimensions: Adds a Dimensions badge (Note: if DOI or PMID is provided just use true, otherwise only add the Dimensions’ identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nhtml: Inserts an “HTML” button redirecting to the user-specified link\npdf: Adds a “PDF” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nposter: Adds a “Poster” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nslides: Adds a “Slides” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nsupp: Adds a “Supp” button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nwebsite: Adds a “Website” button redirecting to the specified link\n\nYou can implement your own buttons by editing the _layouts/bib.liquid file.\n\n\n\n\nA variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the --global-theme-color variable in the _sass/_themes.scss file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at _sass/_variables.scss. You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template.\n\n\n\nYou can add your social media links by adding the specified information at the Social integration section in the _config.yml file. This information will appear at the bottom of the About page.\n\n\n\nYou can add a newsletter subscription form by adding the specified information at the newsletter section in the _config.yml file. To set up a newsletter, you can use a service like Loops.so, which is the current supported solution. Once you have set up your newsletter, you can add the form endpoint to the endpoint field in the newsletter section of the _config.yml file.\nDepending on your specified footer behavior, the sign up form either will appear at the bottom of the About page and at the bottom of blogposts if related_posts are enabled, or in the footer at the bottom of each page.\n\n\n\nTo add secrets for lighthouse-badger, create a personal access token (PAT) and add it as a secret named LIGHTHOUSE_BADGER_TOKEN to your repository. The lighthouse-badger documentation specifies using an environment variable, but using it as a secret is more secure and appropriate for a PAT.\nAlso In case you face the error: “Input required and not supplied: token” in the Lighthouse Badger action, this solution resolves it.\n\n\n\ncontents: access: read and write\nmetadata: access: read-only\n\nDue to the necessary permissions (PAT and others mentioned above), it is recommended to use it as a secret rather than an environment variable.\n\n\n\n\nYou can customize the fonts, spacing, and more by editing _sass/_base.scss. The easiest way to try in advance the changes is by using chrome dev tools or firefox dev tools. In there you can click in the element and find all the attributes that are set for that element and where are they. For more information on how to use this, check chrome and firefox how-tos, and this tutorial.\n\n\n\nal-folio contains a workflow which automatically publishes all posts scheduled at a specific day, at the end of the day (23:30). By default the action is disabled, and to enable it you need to go to .github/workflows/ and find the file called schedule-posts.txt. This is the workflow file. For GitHub to recognize it as one (or to enable the action), you need to rename it to schedule-posts.yml.\nIn order to use this you need to save all of your “Completed” blog posts which are scheduled to be uploaded on a specific date, in a folder named _scheduled/ in the root directory.\n\nIncomplete posts should be saved in _drafts/\n\n\n\nIn this folder you need to store your file in the same format as you would in _posts/\n\nExample file name: 2024-08-26-This file will be uploaded on 26 August.md\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheduler uploads posts everyday at 🕛 23:30 UTC\nIt will only upload posts at 23:30 UTC of their respective scheduled days, It’s not uploaded in 23:59 in case there are a lot of files as the scheduler must finish before 00:00\nIt will only upload files which follow the pattern yyyy-mm-dd-title.md\n\nThis means that only markdown files will be posted\nIt means that any markdown which do not follow this pattern will not be posted\n\nThe scheduler works by moving posts from the _scheduled/ directory to _posts/, it will not post to folders like _projects/ or _news/\nThe date in the name of the file is the day that file will be uploaded on\n\n2024-08-27-file1.md will not be posted before or after 27-August-2024 (Scheduler only works for posts scheduled on the present day)\n2025-08-27-file2.md will be posted exactly on 27-August-2025\nFile3.md will not be posted at all\n2026-02-31-file4.md is supposed to be posted on 31-February-2026, but there is no 31st in February hence this file will never be posted either"

You can find the BibTeX entry of a publication in Google Scholar by clicking on the quotation marks below the publication title, then clicking on “BibTeX”, or also in the conference page itself. By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the Jekyll Scholar section in _config.yml file.\nYou can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the assets/pdfs/ directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the pdf field. Some of the supported fields are: abstract, altmetric, annotation, arxiv, bibtex_show, blog, code, dimensions, doi, eprint, html, isbn, pdf, pmid, poster, slides, supp, video, and website.\n\n\nIn publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array scholar:last_name and string array scholar:first_name in _config.yml. For example, if you have the following entry in your _config.yml:\nscholar:\n  last_name: [Einstein]\n  first_name: [Albert, A.]\nIf the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined. Keep meta-information about your co-authors in _data/coauthors.yml and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically. The co-author data format is as follows, with the last names lower cased and without accents as the key:\n\"adams\":\n  - firstname: [\"Edwin\", \"E.\", \"E. P.\", \"Edwin Plimpton\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams\n\n\"podolsky\":\n  - firstname: [\"Boris\", \"B.\", \"B.

S.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach\n\n  - firstname: [\"Carl Philipp Emanuel\", \"C. P. E.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach\nIf the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided. Note that the keys MUST BE lower cased and MUST NOT contain accents. This is because the keys are used to match the last names in the BibTeX entries, considering possible variations.\n\n\n\nThere are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:\n\nabbr: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the _data folder and adding entries that match.\nabstract: Adds an “Abs” button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text\naltmetric: Adds an Altmetric badge (Note: if DOI is provided just use true, otherwise only add the altmetric identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nannotation: Adds a popover info message to the end of the author list that can potentially be used to clarify superscripts. HTML is allowed.\narxiv: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nbibtex_show: Adds a “Bib” button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry\nblog: Adds a “Blog” button redirecting to the specified link\ncode: Adds a “Code” button redirecting to the specified link\ndimensions: Adds a Dimensions badge (Note: if DOI or PMID is provided just use true, otherwise only add the Dimensions’ identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\nhtml: Inserts an “HTML” button redirecting to the user-specified link\npdf: Adds a “PDF” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nposter: Adds a “Poster” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nslides: Adds a “Slides” button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nsupp: Adds a “Supp” button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\nwebsite: Adds a “Website” button redirecting to the specified link\n\nYou can implement your own buttons by editing the _layouts/bib.liquid file."

How do I fix that?\nHow can I update Academicons version on the template\nHow can I update Font Awesome version on the template\nHow can I update Tabler Icons version on the template\nWhat do all these GitHub actions/workflows mean?\n\n\n\n\nAfter I create a new repository from this template and setup the repo, I get a deployment error. Isn’t the website supposed to correctly deploy automatically?\nYes, if you are using release v0.3.5 or later, the website will automatically and correctly re-deploy right after your first commit. Please make some changes (e.g., change your website info in _config.yml), commit, and push. Make sure to follow deployment instructions. (Relevant issue: 209.)\n\n\n\nI am using a custom domain (e.g., foo.com). My custom domain becomes blank in the repository settings after each deployment. How do I fix that?\nYou need to add CNAME file to the main or source branch of your repository. The file should contain your custom domain name. (Relevant issue: 130.)\n\n\n\nMy webpage works locally. But after deploying, it fails to build and throws Unknown tag 'toc'. How do I fix that?\nMake sure you followed through the deployment instructions in the previous section. You should have set the deployment branch to gh-pages. (Related issue: 1438.)\n\n\n\nMy webpage works locally. But after deploying, it is not displayed correctly (CSS and JS are not loaded properly). How do I fix that?\nIf the website does not load the theme, the layout looks weird, and all links are broken, being the main page displayed this way:\n\nmake sure to correctly specify the url and baseurl paths in _config.yml. Set url to https://&lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io or to https://&lt;your.custom.domain&gt; if you are using a custom domain. If you are deploying a personal or organization website, leave baseurl empty (do NOT delete it). If you are deploying a project page, set baseurl: /&lt;your-project-name&gt;/. If all previous steps were done correctly, all is missing is for your browser to fetch again the site stylesheet. For this, you can:\n\npress Shift + F5 on Chromium-based or Ctrl + F5 on Firefox-based browsers to reload the page ignoring cached content\nclean your browser history\nsimply try it in a private session, here’s how to do it in Chrome and Firefox\n\n\n\n\nAtom feed doesn’t work. Why?\nMake sure to correctly specify the url and baseurl paths in _config.yml. RSS Feed plugin works with these correctly set up fields: title, url, description and author. Make sure to fill them in an appropriate way and try again.\n\n\n\nMy site doesn’t work when I enable related_blog_posts. Why?\nThis is probably due to the classifier reborn plugin, which is used to calculate related posts. If the error states Liquid Exception: Zero vectors can not be normalized... or sqrt': Numerical argument is out of domain - \"sqrt\", it means that it could not calculate related posts for a specific post. This is usually caused by empty or minimal blog posts without meaningful words (i.e. only stop words) or even specific characters you used in your posts. Also, the calculus for similar posts are made for every post, which means every page that uses layout: post, including the announcements. To change this behavior, simply add related_posts: false to the front matter of the page you don’t want to display related posts on. Another solution is to disable the lsi (latent semantic indexing) entirely by setting the lsi flag to false in _config.yml. Related issue: #1828.\n\n\n\nWhen trying to deploy, it’s asking for github login credentials, which github disabled password authentication and it exits with an error. How to fix?\nOpen .git/config file using your preferred editor. Change the https portion of the url variable to ssh. Try deploying again.\n\n\n\nWhen I manually run the Lighthouse Badger workflow, it fails with Error: Input required and not supplied: token. How do I fix that?\nYou need to create a personal access token and add it as a secret named LIGHTHOUSE_BADGER_TOKEN to your repository. For more information, check lighthouse-badger documentation on how to do this.\n\n\n\nMy code runs fine locally, but when I create a commit and submit it, it fails with prettier code formatter workflow run failed for main branch. How do I fix that?\nWe implemented support for Prettier code formatting in #2048. It basically ensures that your code is well formatted. If you want to ensure your code is compliant with Prettier, you have a few options:\n\nif you are running locally with Docker and using development containers, Prettier is already included\nif you don’t use Docker, it is simple to integrate it with your preferred IDE using an extension\nif you want to run it manually, you can follow the first 2 steps in this tutorial (Installing node version manager (nvm) and Installing Node (latest version)), then, install it using npm install prettier inside the project directory, or install it globally on your computer using npm install -g prettier. To run Prettier on your current directory use npx prettier . --write.\n\nYou can also disable it for your repo. For this, just delete the file .github/workflows/prettier.yml.\n\n\n\nAfter I update my site with some new content, even a small change, the GitHub action throws an error or displays a warning. What happened?\nProbably your GitHub workflow is throwing an error like this:\n/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.0.2/x64/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/bundler-2.5.5/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:304:in `check_for_activated_spec!': You have already activated uri 0.10.1, but your Gemfile requires uri 0.13.0. Since uri is a default gem, you can either remove your dependency on it or try updating to a newer version of bundler that supports uri as a default gem. (Gem::LoadError)\nor maybe displaying a warning like one of these:\nNode.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/checkout@v3. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.\nNode.js 16 actions are deprecated.

For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.\nThe following actions uses node12 which is deprecated and will be forced to run on node16: actions/checkout@v2, actions/cache@v2. For more info: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-13-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node16-instead-of-node12-by-default/\nThe `set-output` command is deprecated and will be disabled soon. Please upgrade to using Environment Files. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/\nIf that’s the case, you are using deprecated libraries/commands. This happens because you are using a very old version of al-folio. To fix this it is recommended upgrading your code to the latest version of the template. You will probably need to do some manual merging. If you find it easier, you could create a copy of your repository, do a fresh installation from the template and reapply all your changes. For this I would recommend a tool like meld or winmerge to check the differences between directories/files.\nNote that libraries tend to be deprecated and support for them dropped as they are no longer maintained, and keep using them involves security breaches. Also, some of these deprecations are enforced, for example, by GitHub itself, so there’s so much we can do. We have also added tons of new functionality, as well as tidying things up and improving the overall speed and structure, so you could also benefit from these improvements.\n\n\n\nI am trying to deploy my site, but it fails with Could not find gem 'jekyll-diagrams' in locally installed gems. How do I fix that?\njekyll-diagrams support was dropped in #1992 in favor of using mermaid.js directly. Simply update your code to get the latest changes.\n\n\n\nHow can I update Academicons version on the template\nTo update the Academicons version, you need to download the latest release from the Academicons website. After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the files academicons.ttf and academicons.woff from the fonts/ directory to assets/fonts/ and the file academicons.min.css from the css/ directory to assets/css/.\n\n\n\nHow can I update Font Awesome version on the template\nTo update the Font Awesome version, you need to download the latest release “for the web” from the Font Awesome website. After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the scss/ directory content to _sass/font-awesome/ and the webfonts/ content to assets/webfonts/.\n\n\n\nHow can I update Tabler Icons version on the template\nTo update the Tabler Icons version, you need to download the latest release from the Tabler Icons website. After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the files tabler-icons-filled.scss, tabler-icons-outline.scss, and tabler-icons.scss from the webfont/ directory to _sass/tabler-icons/, and all the files from webfont/fonts/ to assets/fonts/.\n\n\n\nWhat do all these GitHub actions/workflows mean?\nGitHub actions are a way to automate tasks in the repository. They are defined in .github/workflows/ directory. Each file in this directory is a workflow. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs, and each job runs on a virtual machine hosted by GitHub. You can see the status of the workflows in the Actions tab of your repository. For more information, check the GitHub Actions documentation.\nCurrently we have the following workflows:\n\naxe.yml: does some accessibility testing in your site. It uses the axe cli tool with a chrome driver to render the webpage and allow the analysis. Must be run manually, since fixing some of the issues is not straightforward\nbroken-links-site.yml: checks for broken links in your built website with the lychee-action\nbroken-links.yml: checks for broken links in your repository with the lychee-action\ndeploy-docker-tag.yml: adds some metadata to the docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub\ndeploy-image.yml: deploys a new docker image with the latest changes to Docker Hub\ndeploy.yml: deploys the website to GitHub Pages\ndocker-slim.yml: deploys a smaller version of the docker image to Docker Hub with the docker-slim-action\nlighthouse-badger.yml: runs a lighthouse test for your site with the lighthouse-badger-action, saving the results in the repository for easy inspecting, as can be seen here. For more information on how to enable this workflow, check our FAQ question about it\nprettier-comment-on-pr.yml: not working. For now, this action is disabled. It was supposed to run prettier on the PRs and comment on them with the changes needed. For more information, check issue 2115\nprettier.yml: runs prettier on the code to ensure it is well formatted. For more information, check our FAQ question about it"

    "section": "The Decision to Pursue Graduate Studies",
    "text": "The Decision to Pursue Graduate Studies\nThe decision to enter graduate school shouldn’t be taken lightly. Unlike undergraduate studies, graduate school requires a different kind of commitment—one that goes beyond coursework to include original research, intellectual independence, and often, a redefinition of your relationship with learning itself.\n\nWhat Graduate School Really Offers\nIntellectual Freedom: Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of graduate school is the freedom to pursue questions that genuinely intrigue you. While this freedom can initially feel overwhelming, it ultimately allows you to develop your own research identity.\nResearch Skills: You’ll develop critical thinking skills, learn to design experiments, analyze complex data, and communicate your findings effectively. These skills are valuable far beyond academia.\nProfessional Network: The connections you make—with advisors, peers, and collaborators—often prove to be among the most valuable aspects of your graduate experience."

    "text": "The Realities and Challenges\nGraduate school isn’t just about the intellectual rewards. It comes with real challenges that prospective students should understand:\n\nFinancial Considerations\nMost graduate programs in the sciences offer funding through assistantships or fellowships, but the stipends are typically modest. Learning to live on a graduate student budget while focusing on your research requires careful planning and often some lifestyle adjustments.\n\n\nTime Management and Work-Life Balance\nThe flexibility of graduate school can be both a blessing and a curse. Without structured class schedules, you’ll need to develop strong self-discipline and time management skills. Finding balance between research, coursework, and personal life becomes an essential skill.\n\n\nImposter Syndrome and Mental Health\nIt’s common to feel like you don’t belong or aren’t smart enough, especially when surrounded by brilliant peers and faculty. Recognizing these feelings as normal and seeking support when needed is crucial for long-term success and well-being."

    "text": "Advice for Prospective Students\nIf you’re considering graduate school, here are some key questions to ask yourself:\n\nAre you passionate about research? Graduate school is primarily about conducting original research, not just taking classes.\nCan you handle uncertainty? Research involves many failed experiments and dead ends before breakthroughs occur.\nDo you have clear career goals? While it’s okay for these to evolve, having some sense of direction helps maintain motivation during challenging periods.\n\n\nMaking the Most of Your Graduate Experience\n\nChoose your advisor carefully: This relationship will significantly impact your graduate experience and future career.\nEmbrace failure as learning: Every failed experiment teaches you something valuable.\nBuild a support network: Connect with other graduate students, join professional organizations, attend conferences.\nDevelop transferable skills: Writing, presenting, project management, and leadership skills will serve you well in any career path."

    "text": "Looking Forward\nGraduate school is demanding, but for those who are passionate about research and discovery, it can be incredibly rewarding. The skills you develop, the knowledge you gain, and the contributions you make to your field can have lasting impact.\nWhether you continue in academia or transition to industry, the graduate school experience shapes how you approach complex problems and think critically about the world around you. It’s not just about earning a degree—it’s about becoming an independent researcher and thinker.\nFor those considering this path, take time to reflect on your motivations and goals. Talk to current graduate students and recent graduates in your field of interest. Most importantly, remember that graduate school is just one part of your career journey, but it can be a transformative and rewarding part if approached with the right mindset and preparation.\n\nWhat questions do you have about graduate school? Feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to chat with prospective students about the academic journey."

Lett.\n    Generalized Substrate Screening GW for Covalently Bonded Interfaces\n    Joseph Frimpong, Zhen-Fei Liu\n    J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 15(8): 2133-2141\n    \n      \n      ABSTRACT\n    \n    \n      An accurate description of the interfacial quasiparticle electronic structure is key to the design of heterogeneous materials. While the first-principles GW approach is state-of-the-art, the computational cost is high for large interface systems. This has led to the substrate screening GW approach for weakly coupled interfaces, which breaks down for covalently bonded interfaces. In this work, we present the generalized substrate screening GW approach, based on the following two considerations: (i) the contribution of the interfacial covalent bond to the polarizability can be efficiently calculated with a low energy cutoff; (ii) the contribution of the deprotonated adsorbate to the interface polarizability can be well approximated by that of the protonated molecule. Our approach is exemplified using interfaces formed between benzene-1,4-dithiol (BDT) and Au(111), which feature the widely used Au-S bonds in experiments. Our work provides a robust and simple scheme for accurate and efficient GW calculations of covalently bonded interfaces.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    JACS\n    Hydrogen Isotope Labeling of Pharmaceuticals Via Dual Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Pathways Using CdS Quantum Dot Photocatalyst\n    Rajendra Maity, Otto Dungan, Frédéric A.

Phillips, Moses Adeyemo, Joseph Frimpong, Timothy Quainoo, Zhen-Fei Liu, Long Luo\n    Journal of the American Chemical Society, 146(49): 34141-34151\n    \n      \n      ABSTRACT\n    \n    \n      Pharmaceutical synthesis often requires hydrogen isotope labeling for drug development and mechanistic studies. Traditional methods suffer from limitations in scope and selectivity. Here, we present a photocatalytic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) method using CdS quantum dots that operates via dual pathways: direct HAT from the CdS quantum dot surface and photogenerated hole-mediated oxidation. This dual mechanism enables broad applicability to various pharmaceutical compounds, including complex drug molecules like celecoxib, roflumilast, and mavoglurant. The method shows excellent deuterium incorporation with high precision and minimal byproduct formation. Our work demonstrates the potential of quantum dot photocatalysis for pharmaceutical isotope labeling applications.\n    \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Chem.

The surface chemistry of QDs plays a crucial role in determining their properties and stability. In this work, we use first-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate ligand exchange processes and surface passivation mechanisms in CdS quantum dots. We examine how different ligands interact with CdS surfaces and how these interactions affect the electronic structure and optical properties of the QDs. Our calculations provide insights into the binding energies, electronic structure changes, and passivation effects of various ligand molecules on CdS QD surfaces.\n    \n  \n\n2023\n\n  \n  \n    Faraday Discuss.\n    Electrochemical Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Amines Controlled by Alternating Current Frequency\n    Nibedita Behera, Disni Gunasekera, Jyoti P. Mahajan, Joseph Frimpong, Zhen-Fei Liu, Long Luo\n    Faraday Discuss., 247: 45-58\n    \n      \n      ABSTRACT\n    \n    \n      Here, we report an electrochemical protocol for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) at alpha-C(sp3)-H amine sites. Tetrahydroisoquinoline and pyrrolidine are selected as two model substrates because of their different proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) kinetics at the alpha-C(sp3)-H amine sites, which are utilized to control the HIE reaction outcome at different applied alternating current (AC) frequencies. We found the highest deuterium incorporation for tetrahydroisoquinolines at 0 Hz (i.e., under direct current (DC) electrolysis conditions) and pyrrolidines at 0.5 Hz. Analysis of the product distribution and D isotope incorporation at different frequencies reveals that the HIE of tetrahydroisoquinolines is limited by its slow HAT, whereas the HIE of pyrrolidines is limited by the overoxidation of its alpha-amino radical intermediates. The AC-frequency-dependent HIE of amines can be potentially used to achieve selective labeling of alpha-amine sites in one drug molecule, which will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry.\n    \n  \n\n2022\n\n  \n  \n    J. Phys. Chem. Lett.\n    Comparative Study of Covalent and van Der Waals CdS Quantum Dot Assemblies from Many-Body Perturbation Theory\n    Sandip Aryal, Joseph Frimpong, Zhen-Fei Liu\n    J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 13(43): 10153-10161\n    \n      \n      ABSTRACT\n    \n    \n      Quantum dot (QD) assemblies are nanostructured networks made from aggregates of QDs and feature improved charge and energy transfer efficiencies compared to discrete QDs. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we systematically compare the electronic and optical properties of two types of CdS QD assemblies that have been experimentally investigated: (i) QD gels, where individual QDs are covalently connected via di- or polysulfide bonds, and (ii) QD nanocrystals, where individual QDs are bound via van der Waals interactions. Our work illustrates how the electronic and optical properties evolve when discrete QDs are assembled into 1D, 2D, and 3D gels and nanocrystals, as well as how the one-body and many-body interactions in these systems impact the trends as the dimensionality of the assembly increases. Furthermore, our work reveals the crucial role of the di- or polysulfide covalent bonds in the localization of the excitons, which highlights the difference between QD gels and QD nanocrystals.\n    \n  \n\n2021\n\n  \n  \n    J. Phys.: Condens. Matter\n    Quasiparticle Electronic Structure of Two-Dimensional Heterotriangulene-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks Adsorbed on Au(111)\n    Joseph Frimpong, Zhen-Fei Liu\n    J. Phys.: Condens. Matter, 33(25): 254004\n    \n      \n      ABSTRACT\n    \n    \n      The modular nature and unique electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) make them an attractive option for applications in catalysis, optoelectronics, and spintronics. The fabrications of such devices often involve interfaces formed between COFs and substrates. In this work, we employ the first-principles GW approach to accurately determine the quasiparticle electronic structure of three 2D carbonyl bridged heterotriangulene-based COFs featuring honeycomb-kagome lattice, with their properties ranging from a semi-metal to a wide-gap semiconductor. Moreover, we study the adsorption of these COFs on Au(111) surface and characterize the quasiparticle electronic structure at the heterogeneous COF/Au(111) interfaces. To reduce the computational cost, we apply the recently developed dielectric embedding GW approach and show that our results agree with existing experimental measurement on the interfacial energy level alignment. Our calculations illustrate how the many-body dielectric screening at the interface modulates the energies and shapes of the Dirac bands, the effective masses of semiconducting COFs, as well as the Fermi velocity of the semi-metallic COF.\n    \n  \n\nShow More Publications"

    "text": "This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte’s styles in RMarkdown documents (xie2018?). The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.\n---\ntitle: \"An Example Using the Tufte Style\"\nauthor: \"John Smith\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    grid:\n1      margin-width: 350px\n  pdf: default\n2reference-location: margin\ncitation-location: margin\n---\n\n1\n\nIncreases the width of the margin to make more room for sidenotes and margin figures (HTML only).\n\n2\n\nPlaces footnotes and cited sources in the margin. Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you’d like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option fig-column: margin for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you2.\n\nIf you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues."

    "title": "Modern Alternatives to Traditional Linux Commands",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Linux command-line ecosystem has experienced a renaissance, with developers reimagining classic Unix utilities using modern programming languages like Rust and Go. These contemporary tools address historical limitations of their predecessors, offering enhanced performance, improved usability, and features designed for today’s development workflows—including adoption by cutting-edge AI coding assistants like VS Code, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot.\n\n\nTraditional Linux commands, while reliable and universally available, often suffer from unintuitive syntax, limited visual feedback, and performance bottlenecks when handling large datasets. Modern alternatives leverage parallelization, optimized algorithms, and user-centered design principles without sacrificing the power of the command line. Their performance and features have made them essential enough that major development tools now rely on them internally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional\nModern\nKey Improvements\n\n\n\n\ngrep\nripgrep\n10x faster, respects .gitignore, Unicode support\n\n\ncat\nbat\nSyntax highlighting, Git integration, automatic paging\n\n\nfind\nfd\nSimple syntax, parallel processing, smart case sensitivity\n\n\nls\neza\nGit status, icons, tree view, better colors\n\n\ncd\nzoxide\nLearns directories, fuzzy matching, faster navigation\n\n\ngit diff\ndelta\nSyntax highlighting, side-by-side view, within-line changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nPerformance Impact: These tools can improve your daily workflow by 30-50% through faster execution, better UX, and reduced cognitive load.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Modern CLI tools offer significant improvements in performance, usability, and visual appeal compared to traditional Linux commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ripgrep tool has established itself as the performance leader for text searching, particularly with large codebases. Built in Rust, it maintains speed while supporting full Unicode and can switch regex engines based on query complexity. Benchmark comparisons show ripgrep achieving 10x performance improvements in multi-threaded scenarios compared to traditional grep, with particularly strong results on compressed data.\nVisual Studio Code adopted ripgrep as its default search engine specifically because of its exceptional performance with large repositories. When you search across your workspace in VS Code, you’re using ripgrep under the hood. Claude Code similarly integrates ripgrep for codebase understanding and search operations, leveraging its parallel processing and gitignore-aware filtering.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install ripgrep  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install ripgrep  # Fedora/RHEL\nsudo pacman -S ripgrep    # Arch Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install ripgrep\nKey Features: - Respects .gitignore patterns by default - Multi-threaded searching across all files - Smart case sensitivity (case-insensitive unless uppercase is used) - Supports searching compressed files and archives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ripgrep demonstrates significantly better performance compared to traditional grep, especially on large codebases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bat command reimagines cat as a syntax-aware file viewer with Git integration. Written in Rust, it provides automatic syntax highlighting for numerous programming and markup languages, displays line numbers by default, and shows Git modifications in a left sidebar. Unlike traditional cat, bat includes automatic paging for large files and can detect non-printable characters.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install bat  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install bat  # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S bat    # Arch Linux\n\n# macOS\nbrew install bat\nKey Features: - Syntax highlighting for 200+ languages - Git integration showing modifications - Automatic paging for large files - Works as a colorized man page viewer - Intelligent plain output when piped\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFigure 3: bat provides rich syntax highlighting and Git integration, making code review much more efficient than traditional cat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere find requires complex syntax like find -iname '*PATTERN*', fd simplifies searching to fd PATTERN. This Rust-based tool achieves superior performance through parallelized directory traversal and implements smart case sensitivity—defaulting to case-insensitive searches unless the pattern contains uppercase characters.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install fd-find  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install fd-find  # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S fd         # Arch Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install fd\nKey Features: - Respects .gitignore by default - Smart case sensitivity - Colorized output for better visibility - Parallel directory traversal - Simple, intuitive regex support\n\n\n\nThe eza tool (a maintained fork of the now-deprecated exa) transforms directory listing with color-coded output that distinguishes file types at a glance. Its --git parameter displays Git status inline (N for new, M for modified, I for ignored), integrating version control awareness directly into file browsing. The tree view capability provides hierarchical directory visualization without requiring separate commands.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo pacman -S eza                    # Arch Linux\nsudo dnf copr enable atim/eza        # Fedora\nsudo dnf install eza\ncargo install eza                    # Ubuntu/other Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install eza\nKey Features: - Git status integration showing file states - Icon support for file types - Tree view for directory hierarchies - Extended metadata display (permissions, ownership, timestamps) - Groups directories first by default\n\n\n\nThe zoxide tool is a blazing-fast autojumper that completely replaces the cd command. It remembers which directories you use most frequently, allowing you to jump to them in just a few keystrokes. Instead of typing cd ~/projects/work/client/application, you can simply type z app and zoxide intelligently navigates to the most relevant matching directory.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo pacman -S zoxide     # Arch Linux\nsudo dnf install zoxide   # Fedora\ncargo install zoxide      # Ubuntu/other Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install zoxide\n\n# After installation, add to shell config (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):\neval \"$(zoxide init bash)\"  # For bash\neval \"$(zoxide init zsh)\"    # For zsh\nKey Features: - Learns your most-visited directories automatically - Interactive selection with fzf integration (zi command) - Works with all major shells (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell) - Orders of magnitude faster than alternatives like autojump or z.lua - Supports tab completion for enhanced usability\n\n\n\nThe delta tool is a syntax-highlighting pager for git and diff output that makes code reviews more efficient and enjoyable. It provides side-by-side diffs, language syntax highlighting, within-line insertion/deletion detection, and extensive customization options. Delta transforms git’s default diff output into a readable, visually appealing format that highlights what actually changed.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo dnf install git-delta    # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S git-delta      # Arch Linux\n# Ubuntu/Debian: Download from https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases\n# macOS\nbrew install git-delta\n\n# Configure as git pager:\ngit config --global core.pager delta\ngit config --global interactive.diffFilter 'delta --color-only'\ngit config --global delta.navigate true\ngit config --global delta.light false  # or true for light themes\nKey Features: - Syntax highlighting for diffs - Side-by-side view option for easier comparison - Within-line change detection - Integrates with Git, diff, and grep output - Highly customizable themes and layouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtop / btop: Interactive process viewers that revolutionize system monitoring with color-coded CPU and memory usage bars, per-core CPU visualization, and mouse support. Unlike top, which requires memorizing keyboard shortcuts, these tools provide labeled function keys for common operations.\n# htop installation\nsudo apt install htop      # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install htop      # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S htop        # Arch\nbrew install htop          # macOS\n\n# btop (more modern alternative)\nsudo pacman -S btop        # Arch\nbrew install btop          # macOS\nprocs: A modern replacement for ps written in Rust with colored, human-readable output and additional information like TCP/UDP ports, read/write throughput, and Docker container names.\ncargo install procs\n\n\n\nduf: Presents disk usage information with color-coded bars and a clear layout, replacing the traditional df command. The tool automatically adjusts to terminal width and can export results as JSON.\nsudo pacman -S duf         # Arch\nsudo dnf install duf       # Fedora\nbrew install duf           # macOS\ncargo install duf-bin\ndust: A more intuitive version of du that provides visual disk space distribution with tree-like structure and ASCII bars. It automatically sorts directories by size and uses colors to differentiate larger files.\ncargo install du-dust\nncdu: An interactive, ncurses-based disk usage analyzer that allows you to navigate directory structures with arrow keys and delete files directly from the interface.\nsudo apt install ncdu      # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install ncdu      # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S ncdu        # Arch\nbrew install ncdu          # macOS\n\n\n\nsd: An intuitive find & replace command-line tool that’s 2-11x faster than sed with simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences. It uses the convenient regex syntax you already know from JavaScript and Python.\ncargo install sd\nbrew install sd            # macOS\njq: A powerful command-line JSON processor for filtering and manipulating JSON data, filling a gap that traditional line-oriented tools like awk cannot adequately address.\nsudo apt install jq        # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install jq        # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S jq          # Arch\nbrew install jq            # macOS\n\n\n\nstarship: The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell, written in Rust. It provides contextual information about your current directory, git status, programming language versions, and more.\ncargo install starship\nbrew install starship      # macOS\n\n# Add to shell config:\neval \"$(starship init bash)\"   # bash\neval \"$(starship init zsh)\"    # zsh\ntokei: Displays statistics about your code, showing the number of files, total lines, code, comments, and blanks grouped by language. It’s extremely fast and supports over 150 programming languages.\ncargo install tokei\nhyperfine: A command-line benchmarking tool that provides statistical analysis across multiple runs, support for arbitrary shell commands, and constant feedback about benchmark progress.\ncargo install hyperfine\n\n\n\ntldr / tealdeer: Community-driven, simplified man pages focused on practical examples rather than comprehensive reference material. tealdeer is a very fast Rust implementation of tldr.\n# tldr (Node.js version)\nnpm install -g tldr\n\n# tealdeer (Rust version)\ncargo install tealdeer\nHTTPie: A user-friendly command-line HTTP client with intuitive syntax and automatic JSON handling, making API testing more accessible than curl.\nsudo apt install httpie    # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install httpie    # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S httpie      # Arch\nbrew install httpie        # macOS\npip install httpie\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a comprehensive configuration to replace traditional tools with their modern equivalents.

    "text": "The ripgrep tool has established itself as the performance leader for text searching, particularly with large codebases. Built in Rust, it maintains speed while supporting full Unicode and can switch regex engines based on query complexity. Benchmark comparisons show ripgrep achieving 10x performance improvements in multi-threaded scenarios compared to traditional grep, with particularly strong results on compressed data.\nVisual Studio Code adopted ripgrep as its default search engine specifically because of its exceptional performance with large repositories. When you search across your workspace in VS Code, you’re using ripgrep under the hood. Claude Code similarly integrates ripgrep for codebase understanding and search operations, leveraging its parallel processing and gitignore-aware filtering.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install ripgrep  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install ripgrep  # Fedora/RHEL\nsudo pacman -S ripgrep    # Arch Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install ripgrep\nKey Features: - Respects .gitignore patterns by default - Multi-threaded searching across all files - Smart case sensitivity (case-insensitive unless uppercase is used) - Supports searching compressed files and archives\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ripgrep demonstrates significantly better performance compared to traditional grep, especially on large codebases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bat command reimagines cat as a syntax-aware file viewer with Git integration. Written in Rust, it provides automatic syntax highlighting for numerous programming and markup languages, displays line numbers by default, and shows Git modifications in a left sidebar. Unlike traditional cat, bat includes automatic paging for large files and can detect non-printable characters.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install bat  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install bat  # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S bat    # Arch Linux\n\n# macOS\nbrew install bat\nKey Features: - Syntax highlighting for 200+ languages - Git integration showing modifications - Automatic paging for large files - Works as a colorized man page viewer - Intelligent plain output when piped\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFigure 3: bat provides rich syntax highlighting and Git integration, making code review much more efficient than traditional cat.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere find requires complex syntax like find -iname '*PATTERN*', fd simplifies searching to fd PATTERN. This Rust-based tool achieves superior performance through parallelized directory traversal and implements smart case sensitivity—defaulting to case-insensitive searches unless the pattern contains uppercase characters.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo apt install fd-find  # Ubuntu/Debian\nsudo dnf install fd-find  # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S fd         # Arch Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install fd\nKey Features: - Respects .gitignore by default - Smart case sensitivity - Colorized output for better visibility - Parallel directory traversal - Simple, intuitive regex support\n\n\n\nThe eza tool (a maintained fork of the now-deprecated exa) transforms directory listing with color-coded output that distinguishes file types at a glance. Its --git parameter displays Git status inline (N for new, M for modified, I for ignored), integrating version control awareness directly into file browsing. The tree view capability provides hierarchical directory visualization without requiring separate commands.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo pacman -S eza                    # Arch Linux\nsudo dnf copr enable atim/eza        # Fedora\nsudo dnf install eza\ncargo install eza                    # Ubuntu/other Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install eza\nKey Features: - Git status integration showing file states - Icon support for file types - Tree view for directory hierarchies - Extended metadata display (permissions, ownership, timestamps) - Groups directories first by default\n\n\n\nThe zoxide tool is a blazing-fast autojumper that completely replaces the cd command. It remembers which directories you use most frequently, allowing you to jump to them in just a few keystrokes. Instead of typing cd ~/projects/work/client/application, you can simply type z app and zoxide intelligently navigates to the most relevant matching directory.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo pacman -S zoxide     # Arch Linux\nsudo dnf install zoxide   # Fedora\ncargo install zoxide      # Ubuntu/other Linux\n# macOS\nbrew install zoxide\n\n# After installation, add to shell config (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc):\neval \"$(zoxide init bash)\"  # For bash\neval \"$(zoxide init zsh)\"    # For zsh\nKey Features: - Learns your most-visited directories automatically - Interactive selection with fzf integration (zi command) - Works with all major shells (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell) - Orders of magnitude faster than alternatives like autojump or z.lua - Supports tab completion for enhanced usability\n\n\n\nThe delta tool is a syntax-highlighting pager for git and diff output that makes code reviews more efficient and enjoyable. It provides side-by-side diffs, language syntax highlighting, within-line insertion/deletion detection, and extensive customization options. Delta transforms git’s default diff output into a readable, visually appealing format that highlights what actually changed.\nInstallation:\n# Linux\nsudo dnf install git-delta    # Fedora\nsudo pacman -S git-delta      # Arch Linux\n# Ubuntu/Debian: Download from https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases\n# macOS\nbrew install git-delta\n\n# Configure as git pager:\ngit config --global core.pager delta\ngit config --global interactive.diffFilter 'delta --color-only'\ngit config --global delta.navigate true\ngit config --global delta.light false  # or true for light themes\nKey Features: - Syntax highlighting for diffs - Side-by-side view option for easier comparison - Within-line change detection - Integrates with Git, diff, and grep output - Highly customizable themes and layouts"

    "text": "Recommended Approach\nThe recommended approach for using al-folio is to first create your own site using the template with as few changes as possible, and only when it is up and running customize it however you like. This way it is easier to pinpoint what causes a potential issue in case of a bug. The minimum steps required to create your own site are (video tutorial here):\n\nCreate a new repository using this template. For this, click on Use this template -&gt; Create a new repository above the file list. If you plan to upload your site to &lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io, note that the name of your repository :warning: MUST BE :warning: &lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io or &lt;your-github-orgname&gt;.github.io, as stated in the GitHub pages docs.\nIn this new repository, go to Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow permissions and give Read and write permissions to GitHub Actions.\nOpen file _config.yml, set url to https://&lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io and leave baseurl empty (do NOT delete it), as baseurl:.\nWait until the GitHub action with subtitle Deploy site finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~4 min. Now, in addition to the main branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch.\nFinally, in the repository page go to Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and deployment, make sure that Source is set to Deploy from a branch and set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to main).\nWait until the GitHub action pages-build-deployment finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~45s, then simply navigate to https://&lt;your-github-username&gt;.github.io in your browser. At this point you should see a copy of the theme’s demo website. After everything is set up, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it. To do so, run the following commands:\n\n$ git clone git@github.com:&lt;your-username&gt;/&lt;your-repo-name&gt;.git\nStarting version v0.3.5, al-folio will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:"

    "text": "Local setup using Docker (Recommended)\nUsing Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.\nYou need to take the following steps to get al-folio up and running on your local machine:\n\nFirst, install docker and docker-compose.\nFinally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.\n\n$ docker compose pull\n$ docker compose up\nNote that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 400MB or so. To see the template running, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080. You should see a copy of the theme’s demo website.\nNow, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don’t forget to change the name!). Also, your changes should be automatically rendered in real-time (or maybe after a few seconds).\n\nBeta: You can also use the slimmed docker image with a size below 100MBs and exact same functionality. Just use docker compose -f docker-compose-slim.yml up\n\n\nBuild your own docker image\n\nNote: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.\n\nBuild and run a new docker image using:\n$ docker compose up --build\n\nIf you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again using --force-recreate argument at the end of the previous command! It will download Ruby and Jekyll and install all Ruby packages again from scratch.\n\nIf you want to use a specific docker version, you can do so by changing latest tag to your_version in docker-compose.yaml. For example, you might have created your website on v0.10.0 and you want to stick with that."

This will automatically trigger the Deploy action.\nWait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the Actions tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the main branch, your repository should now have a newly built gh-pages branch. Do NOT touch this branch!\nFinally, in the Settings of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to main). For more details, see Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site.\n\nIf you keep your site on another branch, open .github/workflows/deploy.yml on the branch you keep your website on and change on-&gt;push-&gt;branches and on-&gt;pull\\_request-&gt;branches to the branch you keep your website on. This will trigger the action on pulls/pushes on that branch. The action will then deploy the website on the branch it was triggered from.\n\n\nManual deployment to GitHub Pages\nIf you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, go to Actions, click “Deploy” in the left sidebar, then “Run workflow.”\n\n\nDeploy on Netlify\n\nUse this template -&gt; Create a new repository.\nNetlify: Add new site -&gt; Import an existing project -&gt; GitHub and give Netlify access to the repository you just created.\nNetlify: In the deploy settings\n\nSet Branch to deploy to main\nBase directory is empty\nSet Build command to sed -i \"s/^\\(baseurl: \\).*$/baseurl:/\" _config.yml && bundle exec jekyll build\nSet Publish directory to _site\n\nNetlify: Add the following two environment variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\nValue\n\n\n\n\nJEKYLL_ENV\nproduction\n\n\nRUBY_VERSION\nset to the Ruby version found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml (for example, 3.3.5)\n\n\n\n\nNetlify: Click Deploy and wait for the site to be published. If you want to use your own domain name, follow the steps in this documentation.\n\n\n\nDeployment to another hosting server (non GitHub Pages)\nIf you decide to not use GitHub Pages and host your page elsewhere, simply run:\n$ bundle exec jekyll build\nwhich will (re-)generate the static webpage in the _site/ folder. Then simply copy the contents of the _site/ directory to your hosting server.\nIf you also want to remove unused css classes from your file, run:\n$ purgecss -c purgecss.config.js\nwhich will replace the css files in the _site/assets/css/ folder with the purged css files.\nNote: Make sure to correctly set the url and baseurl fields in _config.yml before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to your-domain.com/your-project/, you must set url: your-domain.com and baseurl: /your-project/. If you are deploying directly to your-domain.com, leave baseurl blank, do not delete it.\n\n\nDeployment to a separate repository (advanced users only)\nNote: Do not try using this method unless you know what you are doing (make sure you are familiar with publishing sources). This approach allows to have the website’s source code in one repository and the deployment version in a different repository.\nLet’s assume that your website’s publishing source is a publishing-source subdirectory of a git-versioned repository cloned under $HOME/repo/. For a user site this could well be something like $HOME/&lt;user&gt;.github.io.\nFirstly, from the deployment repo dir, checkout the git branch hosting your publishing source.\nThen from the website sources dir (commonly your al-folio fork’s clone):\n$ bundle exec jekyll build --destination $HOME/repo/publishing-source\nThis will instruct jekyll to deploy the website under $HOME/repo/publishing-source.\nNote: Jekyll will clean $HOME/repo/publishing-source before building!\nThe quote below is taken directly from the jekyll configuration docs:\n\nDestination folders are cleaned on site builds\nThe contents of &lt;destination&gt; are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the &lt;keep_files&gt; configuration directive.\nDo not use an important location for &lt;destination&gt;; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.\n\nIf $HOME/repo/publishing-source contains files that you want jekyll to leave untouched, specify them under keep_files in _config.yml. In its default configuration, al-folio will copy the top-level README.md to the publishing source. If you want to change this behavior, add README.md under exclude in _config.yml.\nNote: Do not run jekyll clean on your publishing source repo as this will result in the entire directory getting deleted, irrespective of the content of keep_files in _config.yml."

    "text": "Abstract\nHere, we report an electrochemical protocol for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) at α-C(sp3)–H amine sites. Tetrahydroisoquinoline and pyrrolidine are selected as two model substrates because of their different proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) kinetics at the α-C(sp3)–H amine sites, which are utilized to control the HIE reaction outcome at different applied alternating current (AC) frequencies. We found the highest deuterium incorporation for tetrahydroisoquinolines at 0 Hz (i.e., under direct current (DC) electrolysis conditions) and pyrrolidines at 0.5 Hz. Analysis of the product distribution and D isotope incorporation at different frequencies reveals that the HIE of tetrahydroisoquinolines is limited by its slow HAT, whereas the HIE of pyrrolidines is limited by the overoxidation of its α-amino radical intermediates. The AC-frequency-dependent HIE of amines can be potentially used to achieve selective labeling of α-amine sites in one drug molecule, which will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry."

Tetrahydroisoquinoline and pyrrolidine are selected as two model substrates because of their different proton transfer (PT) and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) kinetics at the α-C(sp3)–H amine sites{,} which are utilized to control the HIE reaction outcome at different applied alternating current (AC) frequencies. We found the highest deuterium incorporation for tetrahydroisoquinolines at 0 Hz (i.e.{,} under direct current (DC) electrolysis conditions) and pyrrolidines at 0.5 Hz. Analysis of the product distribution and D isotope incorporation at different frequencies reveals that the HIE of tetrahydroisoquinolines is limited by its slow HAT{,} whereas the HIE of pyrrolidines is limited by the overoxidation of its α-amino radical intermediates. The AC-frequency-dependent HIE of amines can be potentially used to achieve selective labeling of α-amine sites in one drug molecule{,} which will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry.\"\n}"

    "text": "Abstract\nQuantum dot (QD) assemblies are nanostructured networks made from aggregates of QDs and feature improved charge and energy transfer efficiencies compared to discrete QDs. Using first-principles many-body perturbation theory, we systematically compare the electronic and optical properties of two types of CdS QD assemblies that have been experimentally investigated: (i) QD gels, where individual QDs are covalently connected via di- or polysulfide bonds, and (ii) QD nanocrystals, where individual QDs are bound via van der Waals interactions. Our work illustrates how the electronic and optical properties evolve when discrete QDs are assembled into 1D, 2D, and 3D gels and nanocrystals, as well as how the one-body and many-body interactions in these systems impact the trends as the dimensionality of the assembly increases. Furthermore, our work reveals the crucial role of the di- or polysulfide covalent bonds in the localization of the excitons, which highlights the difference between QD gels and QD nanocrystals."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn accurate description of the interfacial quasiparticle electronic structure is key to the design of heterogeneous materials. While the first-principles GW approach is state-of-the-art, the computational cost is high for large interface systems. This has led to the substrate screening GW approach for weakly coupled interfaces, which breaks down for covalently bonded interfaces. In this work, we present the generalized substrate screening GW approach, based on the following two considerations: (i) the contribution of the interfacial covalent bond to the polarizability can be efficiently calculated with a low energy cutoff; (ii) the contribution of the deprotonated adsorbate to the interface polarizability can be well approximated by that of the protonated molecule. Our approach is exemplified using interfaces formed between benzene-1,4-dithiol (BDT) and Au(111), which feature the widely used Au–S bonds in experiments. Our work provides a robust and simple scheme for accurate and efficient GW calculations of covalently bonded interfaces."

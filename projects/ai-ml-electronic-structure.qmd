## Quick Summary

Generative and surrogate models shorten the feedback loop between expensive many-body perturbation theory and design-ready predictions. I am combining reduced-order models for the screened Coulomb interaction with machine-learned mappings that predict quasiparticle corrections, excitonic responses, and dielectric screening for complex interfaces.

## Current Focus Areas

- Latent-space surrogates that approximate GW/BSE excitation energies across large chemical subspaces.
- Uncertainty-aware models that flag regions requiring direct many-body calculation.
- Workflows that couple PyTorch-accelerated inference with WEST/BerkeleyGW on leadership-class systems.

## Selected Outputs

- [Project overview](https://www.anl.gov/profile/joseph-frimpong)
- Active tooling and notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/frimpsjoek)

## Next Steps

I am integrating data-assimilation pipelines that combine experimental photoluminescence spectra with theoretical priors, and extending the surrogate models to handle strongly anisotropic interfaces.

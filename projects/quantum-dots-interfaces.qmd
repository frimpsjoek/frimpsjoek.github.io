## Overview

This project examined how ligands, solvents, and solid supports reshape the optical and electronic structure of quantum dots. By combining GW/BSE calculations with dielectric embedding and explicit interface models, I mapped the structure–property relationships that control emission energies, hot carrier relaxation and catalytic activity.

## Highlights

- Quantified ligand-induced shifts in excitonic gaps for CdSe nanocrystals and hybrid interfaces.
- Developed workflows for converged Coulomb truncation and surface screening corrections within WEST.
- Collaborated with spectroscopy groups to interpret transient absorption and single-dot photoluminescence.

## Representative Publications

- [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c03470)
- [Chem. Mater. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.4c02232)

## Continuing Directions

Future work focuses on mixed-dimensional heterostructures, integrating machine-learned polarizabilities, and closing the loop with time-resolved experiments.

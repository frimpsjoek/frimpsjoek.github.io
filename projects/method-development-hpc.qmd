## Motivation

Leadership-class simulations demand reproducible pipelines, data hygiene, and responsive visualization. I build tooling that bridges traditional electronic-structure packages with modern workflow engines so that large-scale screening stays transparent and repeatable.

## Core Contributions

- MPI-aware task orchestration for WEST/BerkeleyGW calculations on Polaris, Perlmutter, and Frontier.
- Automated provenance capture and lightweight dashboards for monitoring calculation health.
- PyTorch-based surrogate models that plug into existing workflows to pre-screen candidate structures.

## Resources

- Source and notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/frimpsjoek)
- Internal documentation (available to collaborators upon request)

## Roadmap

Current tasks include integrating ML surrogates directly into WEST's scheduling layer and publishing a reusable cookiecutter for multi-fidelity excited-state screening.

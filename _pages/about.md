## Biography

Joseph Frimpong is a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, where he studies the electronic structure and optical properties of materials to advance applications in catalysis, energy, and optoelectronics. His research focuses on computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT), many-body perturbation theory (GW/BSE), and machine learning, to explore structure-property relationships in heterogeneous interfaces, quantum dots, and other nanoscale materials.

Frimpong has published several peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals such as *The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters* and *Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter*. He has presented his work at leading conferences, including the APS March Meeting and NOBCChE National Conferences. His accomplishments have been recognized with awards like the Thomas C. Rumble Fellowship, the A. Paul and Carole C. Schaap Endowed Distinguished Graduate Award, and the Best Poster Award at the NOBCChE National Conference.

In addition to his research, Frimpong is committed to mentoring and outreach. He has guided undergraduate students and participated in initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in STEM. He is passionate about leveraging computational chemistry and machine learning to accelerate materials discovery and improve the efficiency of next-generation materials.
